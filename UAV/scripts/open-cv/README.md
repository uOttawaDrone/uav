Here you'll find any scripts or code related to the drone's computer vision

**Make sure you install the environment before you run the code!**

1. **You will need to install anaconda.**
2. **Have Python 3.6 installed.**
3. **Go in command prompt and type:**
```
conda create -name opencv-env
conda create -n opencv-env python=3.6
activate opencv-env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**You can find the requirements.txt file under the env folder of this repo.
This will create the environment you need to point to in your text editor to run the scripts.**
